# ui

A very simple UI for the SHACL Validator API.

The user will be able to create a data graph and create a query. The user can then submit the data graph and query and get a result.

## Usage

Start the ui application:

```zsh
% uv sync
% uv run streamlit run app/sparql_query.py
```

Go to <http://localhost:8501> to see the UI.
